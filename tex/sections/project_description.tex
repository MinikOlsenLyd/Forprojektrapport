\chapter{Project Description}
Measure impulse response (IR) of guitar power amplifier and cabinet using both a linear measuring microphone (M1) and a typically applied microphone (M2). Measure the IR’s using different microphone placements relative to the center of the speaker-cone in two dimensions, thus creating a 2D matrix of which an infinite number of IR’s with unique placements can be made. \\
Calculate the difference between the IR’s of both the linear measuring microphone (M1) and the typically applied microphone (M2), in order to create a model of the typically applied microphone. \\
Use this model as a filter to the M1 IR’s and create M3 IR’s that therotically should be similar to M2 IR’s. \\
Apply the IR’s of M1, M2 and M3 to an electrical signal from an electric guitar running through a guitar preamp*. Describe the differences and qualities in tone using M1, M2 and M3 and also the difference in the microphone placement. \\
Finally attempt to tweak one or more of the IR’s to create an IR that sounds as good as possible.
